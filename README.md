This project showcases an Arduino Uno-based rover with a PS4 controller interface. The rover boasts four 65mm rubber wheels, driven by four JGB370-3530 brushed geared motors and controlled by dual L298N motor drivers. It runs on four 18650 Li-Ion batteries with a 4S BMS, ensuring ample power for all its electronic components for approximately 15-25 minutes on a single charge.

## Features

- **PS4 Controller Integration:** Control the rover via Bluetooth using a PS4 controller, enabled by the Arduino USB host shield and a Bluetooth dongle.  
- Support for various control **modes:**
  - **Car mode:** Control a car-like rover using joysticks.
  - **Car mode with triggers:** Control a car-like rover using triggers and the left joystick.
  - **Car mode with accelerometers:** Control a car-like rover using triggers for throttle and the accelerometer for steering.
  - **Funky car mode:** Control a unique car-like rover using the accelerometer for both throttle and steering.
  - **Tank mode:** Control a tank-like robot with separate control for each side using joysticks.
- **Turbo mode:** Activate turbo mode for max speed.
- **Speed mode:** Adjust the robot's speed on the fly. (doesn't apply to the turbo mode)
- **LED and Rumble feedback:** Indicate the current control mode and turbo mode using LED and rumble feedback on the PS4 controller.
- **3D-Printed Chassis:** The project includes 3D-printed chassis and shell models, designed with Fusion 360. These models are conveniently divided into parts for easier printing and assembly.

## Getting Started

To build and operate this project, follow these steps:

1. Assemble the rover chassis and shell using the 3D-printed parts provided in the [3D_Models](3D_Models/Printed_Parts) directory.

2. Connect the motors to the L298N motor drivers.

3. Ensure that the L298N motor drivers receive the correct power supply: raw voltage from the 4S BMS (>12V) and additional 5V voltage from a dc-to-dc step-down buck converter.

4. Set up the Arduino Uno with the required libraries and connect the Arduino USB host shield and Bluetooth dongle.

5. Upload the provided [Arduino sketch](AWD_PS4_RC/AWD_PS4_RC.ino) to the Arduino Uno.

6. Confirm that the Arduino Uno is powered with 12V from an individual dc-to-dc step-down buck converter.
   
7. Pair your PS4 controller with the Bluetooth dongle.
   
8. Power on the rover and start controlling it with your PS4 controller.   


## Usage

1. Control Modes:
   - Press the "Options" OR "Share" button to cycle through different control modes.
   - Control the robot based on the selected mode using the PS4 controller's buttons, joysticks, and triggers.

2. Turbo Mode:
   - Activate turbo mode by pressing specific button sequences on the controller (e.g., L1 + R1 + Triangle + Left).
   - Turbo mode increases the robot's speed.

3. Speed Mode:
   - Adjust the robot's speed by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons on the controller.

4. LED Feedback:
   - The LED on the PS4 controller provides feedback on the current control mode and turbo mode status.
